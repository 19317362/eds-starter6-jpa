If Eclipse gives error on "The Maven APT plugin has a known issue that prevents its usage directly from Eclipse..."

SOLUTION 1



"The Maven APT plugin has a known issue that prevents its usage directly from Eclipse. 
Eclipse users must create the Querydsl query types manually by running the command mvn generate-sources at command prompt."

So i execute the command line mvn generate-sources in my project floder with console cmd and 
i got my Qclasses generated.

SOLUTION 2 from @informatik01 comment

we can explicitly specified JVM in the eclipse.ini like that :

-vm

path\to\javaw.exe

 -vmargs...

The -vm option must occur before the -vmargs option and for more info read @informatik01 comment below.
